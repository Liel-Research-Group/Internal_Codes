Zalachoris-Rathje 2019 GMPE

The following Matlab files apply the ground motion prediction equation preseneted in "Ground Motion Model for Small-to-Moderate Earthquakes 
in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas" (2019) by Georgios Zalachoris and Ellen M. Rathje. The equation presented in this paper is dependent on 
"Referenced Empirical Ground-Motion Model for Eastern North America" (2015) by Behzad Hasani and Gail M. Atkinson which is dependent on
"NGA-West2 Equations for Predicting PGA, PGV, and 5% Damped PSA for Shallow Crustal Earthquakes" (2014) by David M. Boore, Jonathan P. Stewart, 
Emel Seyhan, and Gail M. Atkinson. 

This GMPE is only valid for Mw 3.0 - Mw 5.8.

The ZR19.m is the main file to run and is dependent on the following files:
   ZR_19.mat, HA_15.m, HA_15.mat, BSSA_14.m, and BSSA_14.mat

The .m files are the individual GMPEs and the .mat files are their coefficients as presented in the papers for each

Inputs required are:
	siteprop.Rjb (epicentral distance)
	siteprop.VS30(shear wave velocity in the top 30 m)
	siteprop.T (Period of analysis, for PGA set T = 0, for PGV set T = -1)
	faultprop.M (Moment magnitude of event)
	faultprop.d (Depth of event)

The spectral acceleration (in g) will be outputted at the period of analysis will be outputted unless T is set to 0 or -1.
For T = 0, PGA (in g) will be outputted.
For T = -1, PGV (in cm/s) will be outputted.
